# Game-Library
A database to track video  game cost, play time, and other statistics. 

This project started as a single google sheet where I tracked my video game purchases and time played. Over time I added so much statistical analysis functions that it overwhelmed the google sheet. After several iterations of optimization on Google Sheets, I re-built the whole thing using PHP any MySQL. That has devolved into unmaintainable spagetti code so now it is being re-built again in python with special care taken to use object oriented functions and pytest unit tests.
